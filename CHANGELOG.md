# Overview

This file should contain release notes between tagged versions of the product. Please update this file with your pull
requests so that whoever deploys a given version can file the relevant changes under the corresponding version.

Add changes to the "Unreleased Changes" section. Once you create a version (and tag it), move the unreleased changes
to a section with the version name.

    it results in validation failure

  * Tools (CLI and JRE) are now stored in `{site}/zatca-tools`
  * A patch migrates existing files if any, but it'll only work for self-hosted instances (on frappe cloud, the files
    would be lost before the patch is run)

## 0.32.2

  blank status for cleared invoices

* Hot fix: When parsing ZATCA errors, handle plain string errors without code or category. In certain cases, like the 
  seller name being too long, the ZATCA response included plain errors which caused error parsing itself to fail prior
  to logging the failure

## 0.23.1

* Hot fix for customer creation on frappe v15.38.0 ([Issue](https://github.com/lavaloon-eg/ksa_compliance/issues/86))

  of Standard Tax Invoice

## 0.18.0

* Support arabic translation for ZATCA tax categories.
* Add link for related integration log in Sales Invoice Additional Fields.
* Fix buyer country code in ZATCA XML
  * We used to include the country ID itself (e.g. Saudi Arabia) instead of the code (SA)
* Fix detection of standard sales invoices when ZATCA business settings is set to "Let the system decide"
  * We rely on whether the buyer has a VAT registration number, but we were setting buyer info after we've already
    detected invoice type, resulting in always thinking it's a simplified invoice.
* Specify invoice types when generating CSR
  * We used to hard code 0100 (simplified). Now we generate 1000 (standard), 0100 (simplified), or 1100 (both) depending
    on the configuration in ZATCA business settings
  * Note that this requires redoing the onboarding (production only) if the setting is changed because it requires 
    doing compliance checks for that invoice type.
* Update clearance API integration to send the "Clearance-Status" flag

  * Require all fields in the compliance prompt
  * Report the detailed ZATCA responses in an error log and link to it after the operation to enable users to report 
    problems

## 0.16.0

* Default to "Standard rate" if a sales invoice doesn't specify a tax category
  * We added a validation check to ensure a tax category is present, but that doesn't work for old submitted invoices.
    Such invoices could have been rejected for a variety of reasons, and we need to default to S tax category if they
    don't specify one when attempting to fix the rejection.
* Support fixing rejected sales invoices 
  * A fixable rejection can happen in mainly two cases:
    1) Bad or missing ZATCA configuration that leads to rejection. These cases can be fixed by updating the 
       configuration and generating another 'Sales Invoice Additional Fields' document for the invoice to submit to
       ZATCA
    2) An application bug that results in generating an invalid XML. These cases can be fixed by updating the app to a 
       later version that fixes the issue, then generating another 'Sales Invoice Additional Fields' document to submit
       to ZATCA
  * This change adds a custom button to the 'Sales Invoice Additional Fields' document that allows users to trigger the
    aforementioned generation.
  * Also, the invoice counter was appended to the 'Sales Invoice Additional Fields' name expression to ensure uniqueness.

  * Existing "ZATCA Business Settings" are automatically set to "Manual" by a patch upon deploying this change
  * New "ZATCA Business Settings" default to "Automatic"

## 0.12.1

* Rework submission to ZATCA to avoid committing partial invoices

This rework addresses a problem in live sync mode, where we immediately submit
invoices to ZATCA upon invoice submission.

Here's how it worked before this change. When an invoice is submitted
(`on_submit` hook), we create an associated 'Sales Invoice Additional Fields'
document (SIAF for short) which produces the signed XML that'll be sent to
ZATCA. If live sync is enabled, we immediately committed at this point
before submitting the SIAF, which submits it to ZATCA in the `before_submit`
method. The db commit was added as part of handling the 'Resend' scenario in
ZATCA where there's an internal ZATCA error requiring us to resend the XML as
is later. In that case, we wanted to keep the SIAF as draft, which we did by
raising an exception in `before_submit`. The database commit was added to
preserve the SIAF, as frappe rolls back the transaction when an exception is
raised.

During frappe's review, they pointed out that committing during the `on_submit`
hook is problematic, since it may involve other apps with hooks that haven't
been called yet. These apps may raise an error that requires rolling back the
invoice submission transaction, only that won't work because we've already
committed.

The old logic has several issues:
* It makes submitting the document submit to ZATCA. Aborting a document
submission requires raising an exception, which gave us no choice other than to
make the problematic commit or switch some tables to MyISAM or Aria
non-transactional engines. If we reverse the notion--i.e. we submit to ZATCA,
and only if that results in a non-Resend status, we submit the document--we
no longer have to raise an exception to abort anything. Submission only happens
when everything's fine, and no custom logic is needed in `before_submit`.
* It runs too much logic in the context of invoice submission. Initially, we
thought it would be a good idea to abort invoice submission completely if it
failed ZATCA integration. However, as the ZATCA integration got more complicated
(e.g. resend), this behavior no longer makes sense. If an ERPNext invoice is
submitted successfully, it should go through. If ZATCA integration fails later
(e.g. due to a misconfiguration), the invoice can be corrected after
fixing the configuration with debit/credit notes.

The new behavior is as follows:

Upon invoice submission, we insert the SIAF as "Ready for Batch". If live sync
is enabled, we queue the submission to ZATCA `submit_to_zatca` after commit
(`enqueue_after_commit=True`). If the transaction rolls back, we're fine because
the ZATCA submission won't run. If the invoice submission commits, our ZATCA
submission logic doesn't run in the context of a document submission, so it
doesn't raise any exceptions. It chugs along, creating logs, updating itself
with the result received from ZATCA. If the integration status is anything
other than 'Resend', it submits itself.

As part of this new behavior, we're removing the permission to "Submit" SIAF
from Desk from users. We'll likely add a new action on the SIAF to submit to
ZATCA at some point. For now, such cases are covered by running the sync process
manually from the 'EInvoicing Sync' page.

## 0.10.1

* Fix jinja error if taxes are not defined for any lines in the invoice
    * Previously, our tax logic only added the relevant fields if tax details were found in the item wise tax details on
      taxes and charges template for the invoice. That meant if this info was missing for any reason, our template would
      raise an excpetion when trying to round the non-existent "total_amount" for the item line
    * We now properly set the tax percent and tax amount to 0 if they're missing
    * This will generate a proper invoice which will later fail ZATCA validation (e.g. during compliance)

## 0.10.0
